REQUIREMENTS
------------
This module requires Drupal 6.x, as well as the
Profile module (included in Drupal).

INSTALLATION
------------

  1. Copy all the module files into a subdirectory called
     sites/all/modules/skype_status/ under your Drupal installation
     directory.

  2. Go to Administer >> Site building >> Modules and enable the
     Skype Status module.

  3. Go to Administer >> User management >> Profiles and create a new
     single-line textfield that will hold your users' Skype IDs. You can
     name and title this field anything you like, but make sure that the
     field's Visibility setting is either of the two "Public field, content
     shown on profile page" options.

  4. Go to Administer >> Site configuration >> Skype status to review and
     change the configuration options to your liking. Specifically, select
     the profile field that you created in the previous step. You may also
     hide the title of the field if you so wish.

  5. Go to My account, click Edit, input your Skype ID into the profile
     field you created in step 3, and click Save; when your profile page is
     displayed, you should see your Skype status and your Skype ID should
     have become converted to a skype:// link.

  6. (See README.txt for information on submitting bug reports.)

FURTHER USAGE
-------------

  The module does currently support views integration.  You will see display
  options for both "Skype Button" and "Skype ID (plain text)" when using
  the skype ID field within views displays.
